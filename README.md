# ASHI 2021 HLA Data Analysis for Population Genetic and Disease Association Studies Workshop
This repository contains materials for the HLA Data Analysis Workshop at the 2021 ASHI Meeting.

These materials consist of a 'toy' dataset for data analysis (ASHItoy.txt) and an R script (ASHI.R) for use in the workshop. To download these files, right-click on the name of each file above, and select 'Download'.

To use these files, Workshop participants should have *R*, *Rstudio*, and *BIGDAWG* installed on their machines. 

To install R for your local environment, follow the instructions for linux, macOS, or Windows [here](https://cran.r-project.org).

Once R is installed, install Rstudio in your local environment using the instructions for your variety of linux, macOS or Windows [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Once Rstudio has been installed, open Rstudio (by double clicking the icon) and install BIGDAWG in the Rstudio environment by doing the following:
- Go to the Tools pulldown menu, and select "Install Packages ...".
- In the popup window, select "Repository (CRAN)" in the "Install from:" menu, and enter "BIGDAWG" in the "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma): menu.
- Click the "**Install**" button.

Installing BIGDAWG will automatically install all of the other R packages that BIGDAWG requires. This may take a few minutes, and may generate a lot of text in your Rstudio console.
