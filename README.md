# ASHI 2021 HLA Data Analysis for Population Genetic and Disease Association Studies Workshop
This repository contains materials for the HLA Data Analysis Workshop at the 2021 ASHI Meeting.

These materials consist of a 'toy' dataset for data analysis (ASHItoy.txt) and an R script (ASHI.R) for use in the workshop. 

To use these files, first make a new folder called "ASHI2021" in your Documents folder. Then do the following:
- Click the green **Code** button above, and click 'Download ZIP'.
- Unzip the "ASHI2021Workshop-main.zip" file in your Downloads folder (either by double-clicking it, or by right-clicking, depending on your system). This will create a new folder called "ASHI2021Workshop-main" in your Downloads folder. 
- Move the ASHItoy.txt and ASHI.R files in the Downloads/ASHI2021Workshop-main folder to your Documents/ASHI2021 folder.

To use these files, Workshop participants should have *R*, *Rstudio*, and *BIGDAWG* installed on their computers. 

To install R on your computer, follow the instructions for linux, macOS, or Windows [here](https://cran.r-project.org).

Once R is installed, install Rstudio on your computer using the instructions for your variety of linux, macOS or Windows [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Once Rstudio has been installed, open Rstudio (by double clicking the icon). 

Install BIGDAWG in the Rstudio environment by doing the following:
- Go to the Tools pulldown menu, and select "Install Packages ...".
- In the popup window, select "Repository (CRAN)" in the "Install from:" menu, and enter "BIGDAWG" in the "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" menu.
- Click the "**Install**" button.

Installing BIGDAWG will automatically install all of the other R packages that BIGDAWG requires. This may take a few minutes, and may generate a lot of text in your Rstudio console. This is normal.
